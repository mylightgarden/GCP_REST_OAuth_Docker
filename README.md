This project exercised on implementing a RESTful backend application by using Google Cloud, Node.js and JSon/NoSQL database. 

The project provided CRUD operations on unprotected and protected entities (accessible with correct JWT), and support http status codes 200, 201, 204, 400, 401, 403, 405 and 406. It also demonstrated knowledge of pagination, one-to-one and one-to-many relationships between entitites. 

The application is made to be hosted on Google Cloud, authurized by Auth0, and can be tested with the given Postman environment and collection. Examples of postman testing screenshots on several senarios are provided in "Postman_Screenshots_REST_API.pdf". 

For project specifications and API details, see the "REST_API_Spec.pdf".
